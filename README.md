Orion Performance Optimizer

Introduction: Orion Tweak is a mod that are created for some people who want to increase their phone performance. with tons of scripts and mods/tweaks compressed into 1 FLASHABLE ZIP, i managed to improve Android System Performance, Smoothness, increase total gaming performance to it's maximum level, improve battery life without costing a performance loss No settings/customization and rest 'headache' - all parameters are individual for EVERY device depending on it's hardware/software characteristics, All parameters are very balanced.

Detailed Tech Introductory : Very wide-range settings of OS and Linux kernel are configured, still being cross-platform utility, maximally compatible with all devices. This means that it doesn't have any dirty hacks/hardcore and 3rd part binaries (except busybox) & config files. FDE applies configurations depending on It's hardware and software, so that in the end every device is configured individually. New unique method of execution, System partitions are remounted RW only once while installation. This means high speed (the worst RAM will have at least ~500MB/s of I/O speed), no power consumption (no NAND memory I/O occurs) and security (system partitions are in read-only state). Also new-gen FDE is synced with OS boot process - so tweaks will be applied in correct time. All system partitions are trimmed and checked for errors after every OS boot with ORION onboard.

Info : This tweak was made of : Init.d, Build.prop and other files that edits Kernel parameters in real-time scenarios

Some notes here :

you should read at least install instructions stated in this post - i won`t offer support for any issues regarding installation;
bug reports without device variant and logs can't be considered bugs - make sure you provide detailed info when reporting bugs;
press 'Thanks' button instead of saying it - it will keep the thread clean and keep me motivated to do more;
if you take any of my work without my permission i'll hunt you down mofo.
Compability/Requirements :

Supported CPU arch's:
ARMv7 (armeabi-v7a) (32bit)
ARMv8 (arm64-v8a) (64bit)
x64bit (x86_64)
Supported Android Version :

Android 5.0 (Lollipop) and higher
Orion is much better to use in :

1-3 Gigs/GB of ram
ARM (because it's much easy to handle)
Mediatek/Snapdragon

How does Orion Works Exactly?

Build.prop tweaks will automatically activated after boot.
Init.d will also activated after the build.prop tweaks was successfully injected into /system
The whole process after boot will take 1-5 mins depend on how it can be managed by your phone
Installation:

Do a NANDROID Backup (optional), incase if something wrong (bootloop or others)
Download ORION in release tab [GITHUB]
Flash and Forget.
